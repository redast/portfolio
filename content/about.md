About techniques I use in this page
==========================

This website is build with framework Pico with twig filters and functions. Pico is a flat file CMS. This means there is no administration backend or database to deal with. I simply create .md files in the content folder and those files become my pages.


Styling is made with SASS. I compile my Sass to CSS using the sass command.  For example, running sass input.scss output.css from my terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.
I do also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag to be sure that changes is made automaticaly.
